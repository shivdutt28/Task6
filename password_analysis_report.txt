1. Introduction
This report analyzes the strength of multiple passwords using the online tool passwordmeter.com. The objective was to evaluate how different combinations of characters impact password security.

2. Methodology
Several passwords were created with varying complexity and tested on passwordmeter.com. The passwords evaluated were:
- Password123
- P@ssword123
- password123
Screenshots of the results were captured for documentation.

3. Analysis
3.1 Password Strength Results
- Password123: Score: 43%, Complexity: Good
- P@ssword123: Score: 89%, Complexity: Very Strong
- password123: Score: 75%, Complexity: Strong

3.2 Evaluation Breakdown
- Password123: Lacked uppercase letters and symbols, resulting in a lower score.
- P@ssword123: Included uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and a symbol, achieving a high score.
- password123: Met length and number requirements but lacked uppercase and symbols, affecting its score.

4. Findings
The analysis highlights that password strength improves with the inclusion of diverse character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and sufficient length. P@ssword123 demonstrated the highest security due to its complexity, while Password123 was the weakest due to its simplicity.

5. Best Practices
- Use at least 8 characters.
- Incorporate a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid repetitive or predictable patterns.
- Steer clear of common words or phrases.

6. Security Threats
- Brute Force Attack: Attempts all possible combinations, thwarted by increased complexity.
- Dictionary Attack: Targets common words, mitigated by unique character combinations.

7. Conclusion
This exercise underscored the importance of password complexity in enhancing security against common attacks. Tools like Password Meter are valuable for real-time strength assessment.
