# Cyber Security Internship - Task 6: Password Strength Assessment

## Project Overview
This repository documents the completion of Task 6, which involved creating and evaluating password strength using the online tool passwordmeter.com. The aim was to explore the factors contributing to password security and document the findings.

## Tools Employed
- **Password Meter** (passwordmeter.com)

## Methodology

### 1. Password Development
- Generated a series of passwords with varying complexity levels:
  - Password123
  - P@ssword123
  - password123

### 2. Strength Assessment
- Evaluated each password using passwordmeter.com and recorded the outcomes:
  - **Password123**: Score: 43%, Complexity: Good
  - **P@ssword123**: Score: 89%, Complexity: Very Strong
  - **password123**: Score: 75%, Complexity: Strong

### 3. Documentation
- Captured evaluation results in screenshots:
  - `password123.png`
  - `P@ssword123.png`
  - `password123.png`

### 4. Best Practices Derived
- Minimum length of 8 characters.
- Inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoidance of repetitive or sequential characters.
- Exclusion of common words or predictable patterns.

### 5. Research on Security Threats
- **Brute Force Attack**: Systematically attempts all possible character combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Leverages a predefined list of common words and phrases.

### 6. Security Insights
Enhanced password complexity, as demonstrated by P@ssword123, significantly bolsters security by increasing the difficulty of cracking attempts compared to simpler passwords like Password123. The addition of symbols and varied character types proved critical.

## Key Learnings
- Recognized the impact of character diversity on password resilience.
- Gained insight into how length and complexity mitigate brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Appreciated the utility of Password Meter for immediate strength evaluation.
